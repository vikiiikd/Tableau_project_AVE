# Tableau_project_AVE
This Tableau dashboard analyzes Spanish train (AVE) performance by combining revenue, price flows, and fare distribution. The top heatmap shows average revenue by origin–destination and train type, revealing AVE high-speed routes like Madrid–Barcelona (37,957) and Madrid–Sevilla (24,044) as top earners, while regional and medium-distance services generate less. The Sankey diagram maps ticket price flows between cities, with the strongest connections between Barcelona and Madrid, and notable links from Madrid to Sevilla, Valencia, and Ponferrada. The stacked bar chart details fare type composition for each route, showing how premium AVE routes still sell Flexible fares alongside discounted Promo and Promo+ tickets. Together, these visuals highlight how route choice, train type, and fare flexibility drive revenue in Spain’s rail network.
